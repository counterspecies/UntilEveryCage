    <h1>Their Power is Secrecy.</h1>

    <p>The animal agriculture industry's power is built on a foundation of two things: <strong>propaganda and secrecy.</strong> The propaganda is the myth of the happy farm, the comforting label, the illusion of choice. The secrecy is the brutal, systematic reality behind the walls you see on this map. We are here to shatter both.</p>

    <p>This is not a directory; it is a blueprint of an industrial atrocity. An engine of agony is operating around the clock, and its primary fuel is public ignorance. Every year, it consumes billions of lives. <strong>9 billion chickens</strong> are shackled, dragged through electrified water, and have their throats cut by automated blades—many are still conscious as they are plunged into scalding water to remove their feathers. <strong>120 million pigs</strong>, intelligent beings, are forced into gas chambers where they thrash and scream as carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid in their eyes, nostrils, and lungs, burning them from the inside out. <strong>30 million cows</strong> are shot in the head with a steel bolt and hoisted by one leg to have their throats slit, bleeding out on a factory floor slick with the blood of those who went before them. This is the gruesome reality they spend millions to keep from your eyes.</p>

    <p>Do not use their words. They are not "livestock." They are not "product." They are not "resources." These are weapons of propaganda—carefully engineered euphemisms designed to erase the individual and sanitize the violence. The beings trapped in this system are sentient individuals, each with a profound will to live. To call them anything else is to participate in the lie.</p>
    
    <p>And do not fall for their most effective piece of propaganda: the myth of "humane" treatment. "Humane slaughter" is a marketing term, a grotesque contradiction designed to soothe your conscience so you continue to buy their products. A bigger cage is a more spacious prison cell. A quicker death is still a violent, unwanted end to a life. You cannot "humanely" take something that is not yours to take.</p>
    
    <p>This system of organized violence has no moral defense. It is a tyrannical machine that profits from terror. The only ethical response is its complete and total abolition.</p>
    
    <p>Your passive observation ends now. Knowledge requires a response. Inaction is complicity. Your duty is to become an active agent in the destruction of this industry's power.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>REJECT THE PROPAGANDA.</strong> The most powerful way to fight their lies is to stop consuming them. You must go <strong>vegan</strong>. This is the non-negotiable first step. It is the act of removing your financial support from their entire system of violence.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>DESTROY THE SECRECY.</strong> Share this map. Show it to everyone you know. Talk about what happens inside these facilities. Use the correct words: slaughter, violence, victim. Drag their hidden atrocities into the light. Their power depends on your silence. Break it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>BEAR WITNESS.</strong> Your education in this hidden reality is not optional. You must see what they fight to keep from you. Explore these essential resources to understand the true scope of the horror.
        </li>

    <h4>Foundational Documentaries</h4>
    <p>
        Begin with the unflinching cinematic evidence in <strong><a href="https://www.watchdominion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dominion</em> (2018)</a></strong>, its foundational predecessor <strong><a href="https://www.nationearth.com/earthlings-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Earthlings</em> (2005)</a></strong>, and the environmentally-focused <strong><a href="https://www.cowspiracy.com/watch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cowspiracy</em> (2014)</a></strong>. These films are a necessary, though difficult, starting point.
    </p>

    <h4>Essential Speeches</h4>
    <p>
        Listen to the passionate and uncompromising arguments that have awakened millions. Gary Yourofsky's <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U00LMmC4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2010 address at Georgia Tech</a></strong> is considered one of the most impactful speeches on animal liberation ever given.

</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>To those who own and operate this machinery of death: We see you. We see your facilities, we know your supply chains, we read your shareholder reports. Your empire is built on a foundation of lies and blood, and we will not rest until it has been turned to dust.</p>
    
    <p>We are not asking for reform.
    We are working towards your total obsolescence. It is a moral and historical inevitability.
    <p>And we will not falter.</p>

            <h1>How to Use This Data</h1>
            <p>
                This map is more than just a visualization; it is a starting point for investigation. The data presented here is public record, and with the information provided in each popup, you can begin to pull back the curtain on these facilities and the corporations behind them.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h1>Understanding the Map</h1>
            <p>Each pin on the map represents a facility involved in animal exploitation, color-coded by its primary function:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="color: #D73737; font-weight: bold;">Red Pins:</span> Slaughterhouses. These are facilities where the systematic killing of animals occurs.</li>
                <li><span style="color: #808080; font-weight: bold;">Grey Pins:</span> Processing-Only Plants. These facilities receive already-slaughtered carcasses to cut, package, and process into consumer products.</li>
                <li><span style="color: #8A2BE2; font-weight: bold;">Violet Pins:</span> Animal Research Laboratories. These are facilities registered with APHIS to use live animals in testing and research.</li>
                <li><span style="color: #28a745; font-weight: bold;">Green Pins:</span> Other APHIS Registrants. This is a broad category that includes commercial animal breeders (such as puppy mills and lab animal suppliers), dealers, and exhibitors (like zoos and circuses).</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h1>Investigating Research Labs</h1>
            <p>
                For any research lab (a violet pin), the popup will provide a unique <strong>Certificate Number</strong>. You can use this number to find official reports detailing their animal usage.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to the official <a href="https://aphis.my.site.com/PublicSearchTool/s/annual-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APHIS Animal Care Annual Reports Search Tool</a>.</li>
                <li>Enter the <strong>Certificate Number</strong> from the map popup into the search box.</li>
                <li>You will see a list of annual reports. Open the most recent one.</li>
                <li>Find the <strong>"Column E Narrative"</strong> or any attached <strong>"Exceptions Report."</strong> This section is critical, as it is where researchers must justify any painful or distressing procedures performed <em>without</em> the use of anesthetics or pain-relieving drugs. It often provides the clearest insight into the study's specific methods and objectives.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr>
            <h1>Investigating Corporations</h1>
            <p>
                Many of the slaughterhouses and processing facilities on this map are owned by large, publicly traded corporations (e.g., Tyson Foods, Hormel Foods, Sanderson Farms). Because they are public, these companies are legally required to submit detailed financial reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
            </p>
            <p>
                These filings are a treasure trove of information that companies don't advertise. Here are some of the most valuable reports to look for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>10-K (Annual Report):</strong> This is the most comprehensive report, filed once a year. It contains detailed information on profits, business risks, corporate structure, facility locations, and lists the names of key executives and board members.</li>
                <li><strong>10-Q (Quarterly Report):</strong> This is a quarterly update that provides more timely, though less detailed, financial information. It's useful for tracking recent performance and any new challenges the company is facing.</li>
                <li><strong>DEF 14A (Proxy Statement):</strong> Filed before the annual shareholder meeting, this document is often the best place to find detailed information about the Board of Directors and, most importantly, a complete breakdown of executive compensation, including salaries, bonuses, and stock awards.</li>
                <li><strong>Form 4:</strong> This form must be filed whenever a corporate insider (like the CEO or a board member) buys or sells shares of their own company's stock, providing insight into their personal financial activities related to the company.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can find these reports by searching a company's name along with the filing type (e.g., "Tyson Foods 10-K" or "Hormel DEF 14A") in any search engine.
