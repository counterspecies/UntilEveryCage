        <h1>Their Power is Secrecy.</h1>

        <p>The animal agriculture industry's power is built on a foundation of two things: <strong>propaganda and secrecy.</strong> The propaganda is the myth of the happy farm, the comforting label, the illusion of choice. The secrecy is the brutal, systematic reality behind the walls you see on this map. We are here to shatter both.</p>

        <p>This is not a directory; it is a blueprint of an industrial atrocity. An engine of agony is operating around the clock, and its primary fuel is public ignorance. Every year, it consumes billions of lives. <strong>9 billion chickens</strong> are shackled, dragged through electrified water, and have their throats cut by automated blades—many are still conscious as they are plunged into scalding water to remove their feathers. <strong>120 million pigs</strong>, intelligent beings, are forced into gas chambers where they thrash and scream as carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid in their eyes, nostrils, and lungs, burning them from the inside out. <strong>30 million cows</strong> are shot in the head with a steel bolt and hoisted by one leg to have their throats slit, bleeding out on a factory floor slick with the blood of those who went before them. This is the gruesome reality they spend millions to keep from your eyes.</p>

        <p>Do not use their words. They are not "livestock." They are not "product." They are not "resources." These are weapons of propaganda—carefully engineered euphemisms designed to erase the individual and sanitize the violence. The beings trapped in this system are sentient individuals, each with a profound will to live. To call them anything else is to participate in the lie.</p>
        
        <p>And do not fall for their most effective piece of propaganda: the myth of "humane" treatment. "Humane slaughter" is a marketing term, a grotesque contradiction designed to soothe your conscience so you continue to buy their products. A bigger cage is a more spacious prison cell. A quicker death is still a violent, unwanted end to a life. You cannot "humanely" take something that is not yours to take.</p>
        
        <p>This system of organized violence has no moral defense. It is a tyrannical machine that profits from terror. The only ethical response is its complete and total abolition.</p>
        
        <p>Your passive observation ends now. Knowledge requires a response. Inaction is complicity. Your duty is to become an active agent in the destruction of this industry's power.</p>

            <h1>How to Use This Data</h1>
            <p>
                This map is more than just a visualization; it is a starting point for investigation. The data presented here is public record, and with the information provided in each popup, you can begin to pull back the curtain on these facilities and the corporations behind them.

            <h1>Understanding the Map</h1>
            <p>Each pin on the map represents a facility involved in animal exploitation, color-coded by its primary function:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="color: #D73737; font-weight: bold;">Red Pins:</span> Slaughterhouses. These are facilities where the systematic killing of animals occurs.</li>
                <li><span style="color: #808080; font-weight: bold;">Grey Pins:</span> Processing-Only Plants. These facilities receive already-slaughtered carcasses to cut, package, and process into consumer products.</li>
                <li><span style="color: #8A2BE2; font-weight: bold;">Violet Pins:</span> Animal Research Laboratories. These are facilities registered with APHIS to use live animals in testing and research.</li>
                <li><span style="color: #28a745; font-weight: bold;">Green Pins:</span> Other APHIS Registrants. This is a broad category that includes commercial animal breeders (such as puppy mills and lab animal suppliers), dealers, and exhibitors (like zoos and circuses).</li>
