                    <p><strong>REJECT THE PROPAGANDA.</strong> The most powerful way to fight their lies is to stop consuming them. You must go <strong>vegan</strong>. This is the non-negotiable first step. It is the act of removing your financial support from their entire system of violence.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>DESTROY THE SECRECY.</strong> Share this map. Show it to everyone you know. Talk about what happens inside these facilities. Use the correct words: slaughter, violence, victim. Drag their hidden atrocities into the light. Their power depends on your silence. Break it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>BEAR WITNESS.</strong> Your education in this hidden reality is not optional. You must see what they fight to keep from you. Explore these essential resources to understand the true scope of the horror.

                <h4>Foundational Documentaries</h4>
                <p>
                    Begin with the unflinching cinematic evidence in <strong><a href="https://www.watchdominion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dominion</em> (2018)</a></strong>, its foundational predecessor <strong><a href="https://www.nationearth.com/earthlings-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Earthlings</em> (2005)</a></strong>, and the environmentally-focused <strong><a href="https://www.cowspiracy.com/watch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cowspiracy</em> (2014)</a></strong>. These films are a necessary, though difficult, starting point.
                </p>

                <h4>Essential Speeches</h4>
                <p>
                    Listen to the passionate and uncompromising arguments that have awakened millions. Gary Yourofsky's <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U00LMmC4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2010 address at Georgia Tech</a></strong> is considered one of the most impactful speeches on animal liberation ever given.
                </p>

                <p><strong>JOIN THE UPRISING.</strong> Your individual actions are vital, but organized resistance is what will bring this empire down. Find an activist organization—local or national—and give them your time and your energy. True justice requires organized, relentless, and direct confrontation.</p>

            <h1>Investigating Research Labs</h1>
            <p>
                For any research lab (a violet pin), the popup will provide a unique <strong>Certificate Number</strong>. You can use this number to find official reports detailing their animal usage.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to the official <a href="https://aphis.my.site.com/PublicSearchTool/s/annual-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APHIS Animal Care Annual Reports Search Tool</a>.</li>
                <li>Enter the <strong>Certificate Number</strong> from the map popup into the search box.</li>
                <li>You will see a list of annual reports. Open the most recent one.</li>
                <li>Find the <strong>"Column E Narrative"</strong> or any attached <strong>"Exceptions Report."</strong> This section is critical, as it is where researchers must justify any painful or distressing procedures performed <em>without</em> the use of anesthetics or pain-relieving drugs. It often provides the clearest insight into the study's specific methods and objectives.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Investigating Corporations</h1>
            <p>
                Many of the slaughterhouses and processing facilities on this map are owned by large, publicly traded corporations (e.g., Tyson Foods, Hormel Foods, Sanderson Farms). Because they are public, these companies are legally required to submit detailed financial reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
            </p>
            <p>
                These filings are a treasure trove of information that companies don't advertise. Here are some of the most valuable reports to look for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>10-K (Annual Report):</strong> This is the most comprehensive report, filed once a year. It contains detailed information on profits, business risks, corporate structure, facility locations, and lists the names of key executives and board members.</li>
                <li><strong>10-Q (Quarterly Report):</strong> This is a quarterly update that provides more timely, though less detailed, financial information. It's useful for tracking recent performance and any new challenges the company is facing.</li>
                <li><strong>DEF 14A (Proxy Statement):</strong> Filed before the annual shareholder meeting, this document is often the best place to find detailed information about the Board of Directors and, most importantly, a complete breakdown of executive compensation, including salaries, bonuses, and stock awards.</li>
                <li><strong>Form 4:</strong> This form must be filed whenever a corporate insider (like the CEO or a board member) buys or sells shares of their own company's stock, providing insight into their personal financial activities related to the company.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can find these reports by searching a company's name along with the filing type (e.g., "Tyson Foods 10-K" or "Hormel DEF 14A") in any search engine.
            </p>

            
            <p>To those who own and operate this machinery of death: We see you. We see your facilities, we know your supply chains, we read your shareholder reports. Your empire is built on a foundation of lies and blood, and we will not rest until it has been turned to dust.</p>
            
            <p>We are not asking for reform.
            We are working towards your total obsolescence. It is a moral and historical inevitability.
            <p>And we will not falter.</p>
